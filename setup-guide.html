  <h1>Shared Inboxes: Setup + Usage</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">films@ and hosts@ — so anyone on the team can help</p>
</header>

<main id="main">

  <h2>Quick Start</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Add films@ as a "Send mail as" address in Gmail settings</li>
    <li>When replying to filmmakers, switch the <strong>From</strong> field to films@</li>
    <li>That's it — their replies now come to the shared inbox</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>One-Time Setup</h2>
  <p><strong>Path:</strong> Gmail → Settings (gear) → See all settings → Accounts tab</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Find "Send mail as" → click <strong>Add another email address</strong></li>
    <li>Name: <strong>OEFF Films</strong> / Email: <strong>films@oneearthfilmfest.org</strong></li>
    <li>Uncheck "Treat as an alias" → Next → Send Verification</li>
    <li>Click the link in the verification email</li>
    <li>Repeat for <strong>hosts@oneearthfilmfest.org</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Once set up, you'll see both addresses in the "From" dropdown when composing.</p>

  <h2>Sending and Replying</h2>

  <h3>When you reply:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Hit reply</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>From</strong> field</li>
    <li>Switch to <strong>films@</strong> or <strong>hosts@</strong></li>
    <li>Send</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>View just the shared inbox:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to groups.google.com</li>
    <li>Click <strong>OEFF Films</strong> (or OEFF Hosts)</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Conversations</strong> in the sidebar</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Bookmark the group page for quick access.</p>

  <h2>Moving to Shared Inboxes</h2>
  <p>When you can, send from films@ or hosts@ instead of your personal email — especially for new outreach, reminders, and follow-ups. This way replies come back to the shared inbox and anyone on the team can pick them up.</p>

  <p><strong>For threads already in progress</strong> from your personal email, no need to disrupt — just shift at a natural touchpoint (like a new follow-up or reminder).</p>

  <p><strong>Transition footer</strong> — add this to your first few emails from the shared address:</p>
  <blockquote>You may notice this email is from films@oneearthfilmfest.org — we're using shared team inboxes now so anyone on our team can help.</blockquote>

  <h2>Common Scenarios</h2>

  <p><strong>Filmmaker asks about specs:</strong> Point them to the filmmaker survey. If they've filled it out, confirm what you have on file.</p>

  <p><strong>Host has a question covered in the guide:</strong> Answer directly, then link the Host Guide.</p>

  <p><strong>Reply comes into your personal inbox on an old thread:</strong> Forward to the shared inbox, then reply FROM films@ or hosts@.</p>

  <p><strong>Need to hand off:</strong> No need to forward — it's already in the shared inbox. Tag in the Team Space if urgent.</p>

  <p><strong>Closing out:</strong> Send a quick close: "All set — thanks!" or "Resolved — closing thread."</p>

  <h2>Subject Lines + Quick Habits</h2>

  <h3>Subject line prefixes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>[Action by DATE]</strong> — You need them to do something</li>
    <li><strong>[Q:]</strong> — You're asking a question</li>
    <li><strong>[FYI]</strong> — No action needed, just info</li>
    <li><strong>[Confirmed]</strong> — Closing the loop</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Quick habits:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Confirm receipt:</strong> "Got it — will review by Thursday."</li>
    <li><strong>Close the loop:</strong> "Resolved — closing thread."</li>
    <li><strong>Link, don't describe:</strong> Include actual links</li>
    <li><strong>Point to forms:</strong> Capture data in surveys, not email threads</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cheat Sheet</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>films@</strong> — Filmmaker communications (formats, delivery, QC)</li>
    <li><strong>hosts@</strong> — Host/venue communications (logistics, equipment, scheduling)</li>
    <li><strong>From field</strong> — Always switch to shared address when replying</li>
    <li><strong>View threads</strong> — groups.google.com → OEFF Films/Hosts → Conversations</li>
    <li><strong>Need help?</strong> — Tag in the Team Space</li>
  </ul>
