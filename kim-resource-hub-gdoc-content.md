## Your role

**Host Communications Coordinator & Operational Strategist**

You operate the host communications system — webinar reminders, screening materials, check-ins, follow-ups — and document what works and what doesn't along the way.

---

## Start here

These are the three docs to read in your first few days. Everything else is reference — find it when you need it.

1. **Webinar Cycle Process** — your primary playbook for Stream 1 (the first thing you'll execute)
   → [Webinar Cycle Process — Stream 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NxmvMUHP2Rk3vaNzzDKzwHAAUyb7s1EvpaJ-H262KKA/edit?usp=drivesdk)
2. **SOP Library Index** — the 5-stream operations map showing all communication tracks
   → [SOP Library Index](https://docs.google.com/document/d/136Yxpe1dMzTc46Zxk5tLxD7oe-js9_8VgWA-09rrEhs/edit?usp=drivesdk)
3. **Host Guide** — what hosts see. Every email points them here.
   → https://hosts.oneearthfilmfest.org

## Live tools

| Tool | What it's for | Link |

## Email templates

All templates live in the shared Google Drive folder. These are the active ones for Stream 1 (webinars):

---

## Team — who does what

| Role | Scope | When to reach out |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Executive Director** | Strategic direction, messaging approval, budget, scope | When something is outside your playbook or touches budget/scope |
| **Operations** | Eventbrite, scheduling, venue logistics | When working with event details or scheduling questions |
| **Technical Coordinator** (Garen) | Comms infrastructure, data systems, your primary contact | When templates need review, technical questions, anything you're unsure about |
| **AV/Production** | Equipment, technical specs, on-site setup | When venue tech questions arise |
| **Marketing/Creative** | Trailer reel, graphics, social assets. Requests route through AV/Production. | Don't contact directly — route through AV/Production or Technical Coordinator |

---

## Escalation

- **Host asks something you can answer** → answer from hosts@, your judgment
- **Host asks something you're not sure about** → flag in Google Chat to Garen, respond within a business day
- **Host says they can't make a webinar** → reassure them the recording will be sent
- **Mailmeteor merge looks wrong in test** → don't send. Screenshot and send to Garen in Google Chat
- **Anything about budget, scope, or commitments** → escalate to Executive Director

---

## Data sources

OEFF is in the process of migrating data systems. Here's what you need to know:

| Source | What it holds | Status |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Airtable** | Host schedule, contacts, screening assignments, readiness tracking | **Source of record** — all edits happen here |
| **Google Sheets (warm host list)** | Mailmeteor merge data — names, emails, merge fields | Export from Airtable for mail merge sends |

**For your work:** Airtable is the source of truth for host data. The Google Sheet for Mailmeteor merge fields is an export — if something looks wrong there, check Airtable first. Flag discrepancies to Garen.

## SOP library

Each communication stream has its own step-by-step process doc. Read Stream 1 first — it's your primary work. The others activate as the festival approaches.

| # | SOP | Status |
|---|-----|--------|
| 1 | [**Webinar Cycle Process**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NxmvMUHP2Rk3vaNzzDKzwHAAUyb7s1EvpaJ-H262KKA/edit?usp=drivesdk) — your primary playbook | Active now |
| 2 | [**Deliverables Shipping**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zNZAYPdQV-V7hyCnGnJ9Wy2UGnv_wWIWlGAOIp5ftQQ/edit?usp=drivesdk) — film files, promo, slides, t-shirts | Activates late March |
| 3 | [**Milestone Communications**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19WmKK3AexuxIvuEP7aGqHkKoHrFPq9GWHqaa3URn-xg/edit?usp=drivesdk) — key-date emails (film confirmed, one week out, etc.) | Sends start Mar 9 |
| 4 | [**Host Surveys**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jXlsgP9l0sfhHUKufHnzL-nHNxz4zCAJZI4m-YrNy5U/edit?usp=drivesdk) — 3 forms: pre-event, day-of, post-screening | Forms built before Apr 1 |
| 5 | [**Cool Host Conversion**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nlqqnt070WJgBPPmHhPD6M5Z6z73fgiPdhF-WVIb20k/edit?usp=drivesdk) — uncommitted venues pipeline | Active if uncommitted venues exist |

Supporting references:
- [**Email Template Quick Reference**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qUuZgCqqbAvU41vY9cB_JQwGDpd_MyPv3Ypifv8e0Ks/edit?usp=drivesdk) — all templates, merge fields, send checklist
- [**Who Does What**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PXox5bpJK8SDFxjCS-LYBFX2vAkOVZopMC5OaMJZL1I/edit?usp=drivesdk) — team roles, decision rights, routing rules

---

## Deeper reference docs

These are context docs. You don't need to read them upfront — they're here when questions come up. Ask Garen for links to any of these.

| Doc | What it covers |
|-----|----------------|
| **Host Comms Plan (full)** | The 5-stream strategic map with master calendar |
| **Host Onboarding Runbook** | The full 6-phase host pipeline (Find → Post-event) |
| **Host Access Routing Table** | How hosts access tiered content (public, token-gated, password-protected) |

---

## Three things to track as you work

Keep a running doc with your observations. These are genuinely valuable — they make the system better for next time.

1. **What tripped you up?** Where did the process assume context you didn't have?
2. **What's missing?** If someone else needed to do this next year, what would you add?
3. **What could be tighter?** Patterns you see that could become templates or checklists.

## Your first two weeks

**Week 1 (Feb 28 – Mar 7) — Read, orient, shadow**
- Read: this hub, webinar cycle process, SOP library index
- Follow along as the Mar 2 webinar cycle runs — see the full send sequence in action
- Get set up: hosts@ inbox access, Airtable, Mailmeteor, Send As
- Ask: anything. No question is too basic.

**Week 2 (Mar 8 – Mar 14) — First solo cycle**
- You run the Mar 16 webinar preview send. Garen reviews before you hit send.
- Start your running notes doc (the three questions above)
- Flag anything that's confusing or missing — that's the job working
