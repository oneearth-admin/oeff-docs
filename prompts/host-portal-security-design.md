# OEFF Host Portal & Contact Security — Design Prompt

**Context:** Post-call notes, 2026-02-23. This is a design exploration — do NOT build anything yet.

## Background

OEFF currently has ~100 hosts for 2026. Host/venue data flows through:
- Google Sheets V7 (canonical source)
- Airtable (pre-joined views for venue/film/contact)
- Static HTML venue sections generated by `generate-venue-sections.py`
- A host intake form (`oeff-host-intake-form.html`) that collects info at onboarding

The existing privacy lint (`oeff_privacy_lint.py`) blocks phone numbers, Dropbox URLs, and screening packet URLs from appearing in pre-April HTML builds. But the broader concern is:

**Contact info and financial info (e.g., scholarship recipients) need stronger protection than "not rendered in HTML."** The data exists in Sheets/Airtable but has no access control beyond share permissions on those platforms.

## Three Problems to Solve

### 1. Secure Host-Facing Pages

Some hosts need to see sensitive info (their own contact details, scholarship status, co-host contacts, screening packet links). This info should NOT be on a public-facing page.

**Options to evaluate:**
- **Password-protected static pages** — one password per venue, distributed via email. Could be as simple as a client-side gate (JS prompt + hashed password) that reveals content. Not bank-security, but enough to keep casual browsers out.
- **Unique URL tokens** — each host gets a unique URL slug (e.g., `/host/a3f9x7k2`) that's unguessable. No password needed, but anyone with the link can see the page. Simpler, but less secure if links are forwarded.
- **Cloudflare Access** — if already on Cloudflare Pages, could use Cloudflare Access with email-based one-time codes. More robust, but adds infrastructure dependency.

**Evaluate each option against:**
- OEFF's no-database, no-framework constraints
- The actual threat model (these aren't state secrets — just contact info that shouldn't be googleable)
- Garen's maintenance burden (he's one person doing tech for a volunteer-run festival)
- Host technical comfort (many hosts are community organizers, not tech people)

### 2. Concise Host Helper Page

Separate from the full venue section, hosts need a **quick-reference page** they can pull up on their phone day-of. Think: one-pager with:
- Their venue's key contacts (co-host, AV person, OEFF emergency line)
- Event timeline (doors, start, intermission, end)
- Film title, runtime, any special instructions
- Link to their screening packet
- Their RSVP count (or a link to check it)

This is the "host helper" — a distilled, mobile-friendly view. It could be the thing behind the password gate, or it could be a separate artifact entirely.

**Design questions:**
- Should this be generated per-venue from Airtable data (like venue sections already are)?
- Should it include a way for hosts to flag that info is wrong? (Even just a mailto link with pre-filled subject)
- What's the right format — static HTML page, or a printable PDF, or both?

### 3. Persistent Host Self-Service Updates

Hosts need to update their own info over time — new contact person, changed email, updated capacity estimate. Currently this requires emailing Ana or the OEFF team, who then update Sheets/Airtable manually.

The upcoming survey will collect some of this, but the need is persistent: hosts should have a way to submit corrections/updates at any time, not just during survey windows.

**Options to evaluate:**
- **Pre-filled Google Form per host** — each host gets a form link with their current data pre-populated. They can edit and resubmit. Data lands in a "Host Updates" sheet that OEFF team reviews before merging into canonical source.
- **Airtable shared view with inline editing** — Airtable supports this natively. Each host gets a filtered view of only their venue. But Airtable's UX for non-technical users can be confusing.
- **Simple mailto template** — lowest tech. Host clicks a link that opens an email with a structured template: "To update your contact info, reply with: Name: ___, Email: ___, Phone: ___". OEFF team processes manually. Zero infrastructure, but doesn't scale.
- **Lightweight web form that writes to a JSON file** — a vanilla JS form that POSTs to a simple endpoint (Cloudflare Worker? Netlify Function?) and appends to a JSON log. Requires a small serverless function but keeps data in files.

**Evaluate each option against:**
- Host friction (how many clicks to update one field?)
- OEFF team review burden (updates should be reviewed before going live)
- Data integrity (how do updates merge back into the canonical Sheets/Airtable source?)
- Whether it fits the existing OEFF data pipeline or creates a parallel system

## Constraints to Honor

- No pip dependencies, no JS frameworks, no databases (the OEFF stack is static files + JSON + git)
- Any serverless/cloud dependency should be flagged as a Known Exception with justification
- Hosts are not technical — any solution needs to work for someone who primarily uses a phone and email
- OEFF is volunteer-run — maintenance burden matters more than feature richness
- Financial info (scholarships) is the most sensitive category — if there's a tiered approach, this gets the strongest protection

## Deliverable

A recommendation document that:
1. Picks a preferred approach for each of the three problems (or explains why they should be combined)
2. Maps the data flow: where does sensitive info live, who can see it, how does it get there
3. Identifies what's buildable now vs. what needs more input from the OEFF team
4. Flags any new infrastructure dependencies (serverless functions, Cloudflare Access, etc.) as potential Known Exceptions
5. Includes rough wireframes or layout descriptions for the host helper page

Do NOT build anything. Produce the recommendation document only.
