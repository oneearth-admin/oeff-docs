<h1>Webinar Cycle Process — Stream 1</h1>
<p class="meta"><strong>Owner:</strong> Kim (Week 1 shadowed, Week 2+ solo) &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Backup:</strong> Garen<br>
<strong>Tools:</strong> Mailmeteor, Google Drive, hosts@ Gmail, git (host guide updates — Garen handles until comfortable)</p>

<hr>

<h2>What this is</h2>
<p>Every Monday from now through April 13, OEFF runs a host webinar at noon CT. Each webinar has a three-email cycle around it, plus a host guide update after the recording is available. This doc walks through the full cycle for one webinar — repeat it each week.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The cycle</h2>

<pre>Sun/Mon prior week     →  Preview email (template 03)
Sunday evening         →  Reminder email (template 04)
Monday noon            →  Webinar happens (Zoom)
Monday afternoon       →  Download recording from Zoom
Tuesday morning        →  Upload recording to Google Drive
                       →  Update host guide with recording link
                       →  Send recap email (template 05)</pre>

<hr>

<h2>Step by step</h2>

<h3>1. Preview email — 7 days before (Sunday or Monday)</h3>
<p><strong>Template:</strong> <code>03-webinar-preview</code> in the email drafts folder</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Open Mailmeteor in hosts@ Gmail</li>
  <li>Select the preview template</li>
  <li>Swap in this week's content block (each webinar has its own agenda bullets and prep notes — they're in the template file under "Per-Webinar Content Blocks")</li>
  <li>Merge fields to check: <code>{{First Name}}</code>, <code>{{Webinar Topic}}</code>, <code>{{Webinar Date}}</code></li>
  <li>Send a test to yourself first — check that links work, merge fields populated, formatting looks right</li>
  <li>Schedule or send to the full host list</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Decision rights:</strong> You own this send. No approval needed unless you've changed the wording beyond what's in the template.</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. Reminder email — 1 day before (Sunday evening or Monday morning)</h3>
<p><strong>Template:</strong> <code>04-webinar-reminder</code></p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Open Mailmeteor, select the reminder template</li>
  <li>Swap in the topic and date — that's it, this one is short by design</li>
  <li>Send test, then send to full list</li>
  <li>Best timing: Sunday 6–7pm CT, or Monday 7–9am CT</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Decision rights:</strong> Same — you own it. This is a nudge, not new content.</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. Webinar happens — Monday noon CT</h3>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Attend the webinar (or watch the recording afterward)</li>
  <li>Take quick notes on what was actually covered — the recap email should reflect what happened, not just what was planned</li>
  <li>Note any action items Josh or Ana called out — these go into the recap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Not your job:</strong> Running the webinar, managing Zoom settings, presenting. That's Josh and the OEFF team. You're tracking content for the follow-up.</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. Download the recording — Monday afternoon</h3>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Log into Zoom (credentials in hosts@ account or ask Garen)</li>
  <li>Go to Recordings → Cloud Recordings</li>
  <li>Find the webinar by date</li>
  <li>Download the MP4 file</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If the recording isn't ready yet:</strong> Zoom cloud recordings can take 1–3 hours to process. Check back later Monday or early Tuesday. Don't hold up the rest of your day for it.</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. Upload recording to Google Drive — Tuesday morning</h3>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Upload the MP4 to the shared OEFF Google Drive folder (Garen will show you the exact folder during shadow session)</li>
  <li>Set sharing to "Anyone with the link can view"</li>
  <li>Copy the sharing link — you'll need it for the next two steps</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Naming convention:</strong> <code>OEFF 2026 Host Webinar — [Topic] — [Date].mp4</code><br>
Example: <code>OEFF 2026 Host Webinar — Marketing Promotion — 2026-03-16.mp4</code></p>

<hr>

<h3>6. Update the host guide — Tuesday morning</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> The host guide at <a href="https://hosts.oneearthfilmfest.org">hosts.oneearthfilmfest.org</a> is a single HTML file that auto-deploys when changes are pushed to git. It has a section listing past webinar recordings.</p>
<p><strong>For now (Weeks 1–2):</strong> Send Garen the recording link and he'll update the host guide. This takes him ~5 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Later (when comfortable):</strong> You can make this update yourself. The process is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open <code>hosts/index.html</code> in the OEFF data folder</li>
  <li>Find the webinar recordings section (search for "recording" — it's in a collapsible details element)</li>
  <li>Add a new link following the existing pattern</li>
  <li>Save the file</li>
  <li>In terminal: <code>cd hosts &amp;&amp; git add index.html &amp;&amp; git commit -m "Add [Topic] webinar recording" &amp;&amp; git push</code></li>
  <li>The site updates automatically within a minute</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>No pressure on the git part.</strong> It's a nice-to-have, not a requirement. Garen can keep doing this if you'd rather focus on the comms side.</p>

<hr>

<h3>7. Send the recap email — Tuesday morning</h3>
<p><strong>Template:</strong> <code>05-webinar-recap</code></p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Open Mailmeteor, select the recap template</li>
  <li>Swap in this week's content block (recap bullets, action items, next webinar info)</li>
  <li><strong>Adjust the recap bullets based on your notes from the actual webinar</strong> — the template has suggested bullets, but what was covered may have shifted. Use your judgment.</li>
  <li>Drop the Google Drive recording link into <code>{{Recording Link}}</code></li>
  <li>Send test, check links (especially the recording link), then send to full list</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Decision rights:</strong> You own the send. If you need to adjust the recap bullets from what's in the template — because the webinar covered different ground — go for it. That's your judgment call. If you're unsure about tone, send a draft to Garen in Google Chat first.</p>

<h2>Escalation</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Host replies with a question you can answer</strong> → answer it from hosts@, your judgment</li>
  <li><strong>Host replies with something you're not sure about</strong> → flag in Google Chat to Garen, respond within a business day</li>
  <li><strong>Host says they can't make a webinar</strong> → reassure them the recording will be sent (it will — that's step 7)</li>
  <li><strong>Zoom recording doesn't appear</strong> → check back in 3 hours. If still missing after 6 hours, ask Garen to check the Zoom account</li>
  <li><strong>Mailmeteor merge looks wrong in test</strong> → don't send. Screenshot the issue and send to Garen in Google Chat</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>The shadow plan</h2>
<p><strong>Mar 2 cycle (your first):</strong> Garen runs the sends, you watch. Your job is to follow along with this doc and note anything that's confusing or missing.</p>
<p><strong>Mar 16 cycle (your second):</strong> You run the sends, Garen reviews before you hit send. Ask questions as you go — that's the point.</p>
<p><strong>Mar 23 onward:</strong> You own it. Garen is available but not watching.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Three things to track as you do this</h2>
<p>These are the same anchor questions from your starter project. Keep a running doc:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>What tripped you up?</strong> Where did this process assume context you didn't have?</li>
  <li><strong>What's missing?</strong> If someone else needed to do this next year, what would you add?</li>
  <li><strong>What could be tighter?</strong> Patterns you see that could become templates or checklists.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your notes on these questions are genuinely valuable — they make the system better for next time.</p>
