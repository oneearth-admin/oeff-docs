  <h1>OEFF 2026 — How We Work Together</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Shared channels, clear flows, one week at a time</p>
</header>

<p><strong>What we're solving:</strong> Info ends up scattered in email threads — then we're manually searching to find it later. We want to capture data early (surveys, shared inboxes) so it's already where we need it.</p>

<h2>Our Channels</h2>

<p><strong>films@</strong> — Filmmaker communication (assets, scheduling, questions). External-facing.</p>

<p><strong>hosts@</strong> — Host communication (their needs in, our packages out). External-facing.</p>

<p><strong>Team Space</strong> — Internal coordination (questions, handoffs, heads-up). Internal only.</p>

<h2>Capture Early, Not in Email</h2>

<p>When a filmmaker reaches out, point them to the survey before starting a back-and-forth thread. Info nested in emails gets lost. The survey captures it in one place.</p>

<blockquote>"Thanks for reaching out! Please start with our filmmaker survey: [link]"</blockquote>

<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Every piece of info that lives only in an email thread is invisible to everyone else. The survey creates a record anyone can find.</p>

<h2>Respond FROM the Group</h2>

<p>We've been forwarding and cc'ing. That creates visibility, but the thread still lives in personal inboxes. <strong>Responding FROM the group</strong> is what actually shifts the pattern.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the thread in Gmail</li>
  <li>Click reply, then click the <strong>From</strong> field</li>
  <li>Select <strong>films@oneearthfilmfest.org</strong> or <strong>hosts@</strong></li>
  <li>Send — now the thread is shared</li>
</ol>

<h3>What works vs. what doesn't</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Approach</th>
    <th>What happens</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reply from personal, cc films@</td>
    <td>Filmmaker hits "reply" → goes to your personal. Thread forks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Reply FROM films@</strong></td>
    <td>Filmmaker hits "reply" → goes to films@. Thread stays shared.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BCC the group</td>
    <td>Creates a shadow copy nobody can reply to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Forward + reply from group</strong></td>
    <td>Pulls existing thread into shared space.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Transition footer options</h3>

<blockquote>You may notice this email is from films@oneearthfilmfest.org — we're using shared team inboxes now so anyone on our team can help.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sent from OEFF Films — our team inbox. Reply-all to reach us.</blockquote>
