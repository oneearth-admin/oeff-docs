This agreement formalizes the scope of work Garen Hudson has been performing for OEFF 2026 since November 2025, in ongoing coordination with the Executive Director. Both parties acknowledge that work began prior to formal contract execution and agree that pre-contract work is compensable under the same terms outlined here.

## Scope of Work

The Technical Coordinator role spans two areas that have evolved together through OEFF's shift to a distributed contractor model. Both are part of this agreement.

### Area 1: Technical Operations

- Venue technical assessment and tier classification
- AV planning and vendor coordination across venue tiers
- Film file management, QC, and accessibility compliance
- Day-of technical support coordination (remote), including staffing plan for on-site AV/Tech team
- Print traffic planning, technical accessibility coordination — open captioned files, captioning of trailer reel
- Equipment and rental budgeting

### Area 2: Systems & Coordination

- Data architecture and infrastructure 
- Communication platform migration (shared mailbox setup, adoption)
- Team onboarding design (intake surveys, welcome materials, guides)
- Process documentation and institutional knowledge capture
- Host Guide and Docs Site development and maintenance
- Contractor and volunteer recruitment, evaluation, and onboarding
- Cross-team coordination and workflow design

> Area 2 reflects work that emerged organically as OEFF transitioned from a single-person technical role to a distributed team. This scope was previously unformalized.

## Hour Allocation by Phase

| Phase                       | Dates              | Est. Hours   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Pre-contract planning       | Nov — Dec 2025     | 20           |
| Infrastructure & onboarding | Jan — Feb 2026     | 45           |
| Pre-festival coordination   | Mar — mid-Apr 2026 | 50           |
| Festival week (remote)      | Apr 22 — 28, 2026  | 18           |
| Post-festival wrap          | May 2026           | 10           |
| **Estimated total**         |                    | **~142 hrs** |
| **At $70/hr**               |                    | **$10,000**  |

> Hours reflect budgeted allocation, not a cap on engagement. Garen anticipates contributing additional time beyond these estimates as part of ongoing organizational investment in OEFF's infrastructure and capacity. Compensable hours are tracked against the budget cap; contributed hours beyond the cap are at Garen's discretion.

Weekly hours fluctuate by phase. Current estimate is 6-10 hours/week through pre-festival, tapering to remote availability during festival week. Hours in the Pre-contract and Infrastructure phases reflect work already performed and will be invoiced upon contract execution.

## Scope Boundaries

### Included

All work described above in Areas 1 and 2, including coordination with other OEFF contractors and volunteers in the technical domain.

### Not included

- On-site AV operation during festival week (covered by day-of team)
- External marketing, social media, or public communications
- Fundraising, grant writing, or donor management
- Direct supervision of interns (coordination and onboarding support only)

### Scope change process

If new work arises beyond this scope, Garen will flag it before beginning. If it can be absorbed within the budget cap, a brief acknowledgment from Ana via text, email, or verbal confirmation is sufficient. If it requires additional budget, both parties will discuss before work begins.

---

## Collaboration Model

### Availability

Garen holds full-time AV employment during weekday business hours. OEFF work happens on evenings (after 5pm) and weekends, with brief async check-ins possible during the workday. Garen and Ana hold a weekly Tuesday 1:1 for decision-making and prioritization. Garen will attend the Wednesday 11:45am squad meeting when schedule permits but cannot guarantee weekly attendance.

### Communication

Primary channels: email and text for async coordination, with scheduled calls for decision-making. Live calls are preferred over document review for items requiring Ana's input or approval.

### Delegation

Part of this role involves identifying work that can be delegated to other contractors or volunteers. When Garen recommends bringing in additional support, a brief conversation with Ana is the approval mechanism — not a formal proposal process. Subcontractor compensation is managed separately by OEFF from the collaborator pool and does not draw from this agreement's budget cap. It is understood that all technical operations budget is capped at $20,000. Current allocations within that cap: the Creative Assets Lead (Erin Turney & Co) at ~$4,600, and Host Communications & Coordination Support (Kim Pham) at ~$1,920 pre-festival (festival week on-site support proposed but scoped separately). This leaves approximately $3,480 plus ~$4,000 in equipment budget (which can flex toward labor) for additional support — day-of AV staffing, Cultural Center technical coverage, festival week on-site team, etc.

Garen remains the primary point of coordination for any delegated work within the technical domain.

## Compensation & Invoicing

### Rate

$70 per hour, all work types. No distinction between Area 1 and Area 2 work.

### Budget cap

$10,000 total for the contract term. When 75% of the cap ($7,500) has been invoiced, both parties will check in to review remaining scope and determine whether to adjust the cap, prioritize remaining work, or wind down the engagement.

### Back-pay

Work performed from November 2025 through contract execution date is compensable at the agreed rate. These hours are included in the estimated total above. Garen will submit an itemized hour log for this period within two weeks of signing.

### Invoicing

Monthly invoices submitted to finance@oneearthcollective.org with brief descriptions of work completed, submitted by the 5th of the following month. Payment within 30 days of invoice receipt.

## General Terms

### Independent contractor status

Garen Hudson operates as an independent contractor, not an employee of One Earth Film Festival or One Earth Collective. This agreement shall not be construed as creating any employee or agency relationship. Garen is not authorized to make any representation, contract, or commitment on OEC's behalf except as expressly agreed in writing. Garen is responsible for withholding or paying any income, payroll, Social Security, or other federal, state, or local taxes, making any insurance contributions, including for unemployment or disability, and obtaining worker's compensation insurance. Garen will not be entitled to any benefits that OEC may make available to its employees.

### Work product

Work product under this agreement falls into two categories with distinct ownership:

**OEFF-owned deliverables.** Configured systems containing OEFF data, organizational documentation with OEFF-specific content, media assets, and materials created specifically for OEFF use or distribution are the property of OEC. This includes but is not limited to: venue and host data configurations, the host guide and its content, slide decks, film QC outputs, and any documentation containing internal organizational information. To the extent any such deliverable qualifies as a "work made for hire" under 17 U.S.C. § 101, it is so designated. To the extent it does not, Garen hereby assigns to OEC all right, title, and interest in and to such deliverable. This applies to all OEFF-owned deliverables produced under this agreement, including work performed prior to formal contract execution (November–December 2025) that is compensable under the back-pay provision.

**Retained tools and methodology.** General tools, scripts, methodologies, frameworks, workflow patterns, and reusable processes developed by Garen during the engagement — including those that do not contain OEFF confidential data — are retained by Garen. Garen grants OEC a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to continue using any such tools or frameworks that have been delivered to or deployed for OEC during the engagement. This license survives termination of the agreement.

**Mixed deliverables.** Where a deliverable contains both OEFF-specific content and general methodology, OEC owns the OEFF-specific content and Garen retains the underlying methodology. For example: a data architecture template populated with OEFF venue data — OEC owns the populated instance; Garen retains the template pattern.

**Excluded inventions.** Garen's obligations under this section do not apply to any inventions that qualify fully under 765 ILCS § 1060/2, pertaining to inventions, discoveries, or improvements developed entirely on Garen's own time for which no equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information of OEC was used and (a) that does not relate directly or indirectly to OEC's business or to OEC's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b) that does not result from any work performed for or through OEC.

**Portfolio use.** Garen may reference this engagement in professional portfolio materials, case studies, and future consulting engagements, provided that confidential organizational data (donor information, financial details, internal communications) is not disclosed. OEFF may be referenced by name as a client with prior approval of specific materials.

### Termination

Either party may terminate this agreement, effective immediately upon written notice. OEC shall not be obligated to pay for any services not provided prior to termination. Garen will be compensated for all hours worked through the termination date, including any outstanding back-pay.

### Confidentiality

Garen acknowledges that in connection with the Services he may be provided with information which is confidential and proprietary in nature. During the term of this agreement and thereafter, Garen agrees to treat confidentially all such information and materials that OEC or its agents furnish ("Confidential Information"). Confidential Information is and shall remain the exclusive property of OEC and will be used and disclosed only for OEC's benefit. Garen agrees to safeguard the Confidential Information from unauthorized persons and unauthorized use, and will cease using and return to OEC all electronic and hard copies of the Confidential Information at OEC's request. This does not restrict Garen from discussing general methodologies, approaches, or publicly available information about OEFF.

### Indemnification

Garen agrees to indemnify and hold OEC harmless from all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, fines, costs, and expenses of any kind arising from Garen's breach of any obligation under this agreement.

### Governing law and miscellaneous

This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision. Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts located in the County of Cook. This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties. This agreement may only be amended, modified, or supplemented in writing signed by both parties. If any term or provision of this agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect any other term or provision. This engagement has been authorized within OEFF's board-approved budget for the 2026 festival season.

## Pilot Year Acknowledgment

OEFF 2026 is operating under a new distributed contractor model. This is a pilot year. Both parties acknowledge that:

- Roles and workflows are still being defined and may shift
- This agreement reflects best current understanding of the work
- Flexibility is expected and valued — but flexibility goes both directions
- A post-festival retrospective will inform whether and how this role continues

## Notice Under 765 ILCS § 1060/2

Under 765 ILCS § 1060/2, Garen Hudson is hereby notified that this agreement does not apply to any invention developed entirely on Garen's own time, using no OEC equipment, facilities, or trade secret information, that does not relate to OEC's business or anticipated research and development, and does not result from work performed for OEC.
