## Notes

- Keep the description plain text — calendar invite descriptions render poorly with rich formatting across clients.
- The Zoom registration link goes in both the Location field AND the description body. Some calendar apps only show one.
- Update the description before each session with a one-line note at the top: "This week: [Topic] — [any prep note]". This turns the calendar event into a living reference.
- Don't set calendar reminders aggressively — 30 min default is fine. The Mailmeteor emails are the reminder layer.
- Feb 23 already happened. If sending the invite now, either start the recurrence from Mar 2, or include all dates and note which have recordings available.

## Sending Strategy

Option A — Send as a recurring series from hosts@ Google Calendar. Hosts get one invite, see all dates.

Option B — Send as individual events per session. More control per-session, but 7 calendar invites feels heavy.

**Recommendation: Option A.** One recurring invite. Update the description weekly. Less inbox noise, hosts see the full arc.
