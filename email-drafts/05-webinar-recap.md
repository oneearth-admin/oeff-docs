## Notes

- "Thank you for showing up for your community" — this is the partnership frame. They're not attending our meeting, they're doing something for their neighborhood.
- Recap bullets should be 3 items max. If there's more, it goes on the Host Guide.
- Action items are concrete and time-bound. No "feel free to" — just say what to do.
