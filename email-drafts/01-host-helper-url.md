Hi there,

Thank you for hosting a One Earth Film Festival screening at **{{Venue Name}}** this year!

We've created a personalized host helper page for your venue with your event timeline, key contacts, and screening packet (when available):

**{{Host Helper URL}}**

Bookmark this link — it's your one-stop reference for everything you need as a host. The page will be updated as we get closer to your event date with screening packet downloads and other details.

A few things to note:
- This link is unique to your venue. Please don't share it publicly.
- Your screening packet download will appear on this page approximately 3 weeks before your event.
- If anything on the page is incorrect, there's a "Something wrong?" section at the bottom with a direct email link to our host team.

You'll receive a separate email shortly with your financial information password.

Thank you for being part of One Earth 2026!

Warm regards,
The One Earth Film Festival Team
