<h1>Kim Kickoff Meeting</h1>
<p class="subtitle">30 minutes &mdash; Garen + Ana + Kim &mdash; Week of Feb 17</p>

<h2>Meeting Purpose</h2>
<p>Get Kim oriented and aligned on her first project. She should leave this call knowing exactly what to do, who to ask, and what "done" looks like.</p>

<h2>Agenda</h2>

<table>
<tr><th>Time</th><td><strong>Topic</strong></td></tr>
<tr><th>0:00&ndash;5:00</th><td>
  <strong>Intros and context</strong><br>
  How Kim got connected to OEFF. What excites her about this. Quick round of who does what.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>5:00&ndash;15:00</th><td>
  <strong>OEFF in plain language (Ana leads)</strong><br>
  <ul>
    <li>What the festival is: community venues screening environmental films across Chicagoland</li>
    <li>What this year looks like: ~15+ venues, April 22&ndash;28, distributed model with contractors</li>
    <li>Where communication breaks down: multiple channels, unclear routing, everything funneling through 2&ndash;3 people</li>
    <li>Where we are with adoption: we've been moving from manual coordination to platform-based tools (shared inboxes, host guide, webinar registration). It's working, but there have been stumbly moments &mdash; a date display issue confused some hosts, and the team is still building muscle memory around the new workflows. That's normal for year one, not dysfunction.</li>
    <li>What we're hoping Kim can help with: fresh perspective on whether our docs and processes make sense to someone who doesn't already know everything</li>
  </ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><th>15:00&ndash;22:00</th><td>
  <strong>The starter project (Garen walks through)</strong><br>
  <ul>
    <li>What she's reviewing: host guide, team docs site, host communication templates</li>
    <li>The three anchor questions: What's unclear? What's missing? What could be systematized?</li>
    <li>Where the materials live: Google Drive folder + NotebookLM workspace</li>
    <li>Timeline: ~6&ndash;8 hours over 10 days, deliverable is an audit summary in whatever format feels natural</li>
    <li>Compensation: $40/hr, drawn from collaborator pool</li>
  </ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><th>22:00&ndash;27:00</th><td>
  <strong>Logistics</strong><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Primary contact: Garen for day-to-day questions</li>
    <li>Check-in: quick sync after ~1 week</li>
    <li>Communication: email or text, whatever Kim prefers</li>
    <li>Confirm access: Google Drive shared, NotebookLM set up</li>
  </ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><th>27:00&ndash;30:00</th><td>
  <strong>Questions and close</strong><br>
  Open floor. Anything unclear? Anything she wants to know about the team or the org before diving in?
</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Before the Meeting (Garen's Prep)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Create Google Drive folder "OEFF &mdash; Kim Onboarding" with curated 12-doc reading list</li>
  <li>Set up NotebookLM notebook with the same docs</li>
  <li>Send Kim the proposal (.docx) and starter project brief before the call</li>
  <li>Confirm calendar invite with Ana and Kim</li>
</ul>

<h2>After the Meeting</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Kim starts independent review</li>
  <li>Garen checks in at ~1 week mark</li>
  <li>Kim delivers audit summary at ~10 days</li>
  <li>30-min debrief call: Garen + Kim (Ana optional)</li>
  <li>Decide together whether to move to Phase 2</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<strong>What success looks like:</strong> Kim understands the org well enough to spot structural issues, not just surface ones. We get honest signal about whether her process background translates. Low onboarding cost &mdash; the review <em>is</em> the onboarding.
