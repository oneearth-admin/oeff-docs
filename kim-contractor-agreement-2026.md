# OEFF 2026 — Contractor Agreement: Host Communications & Coordination Support

**Kim Pham**

---

## Agreement Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Contractor** | Kim Pham |
| **Organization** | One Earth Film Festival |
| **Role** | Host Communications & Coordination Support |
| **Coordinates With** | Garen Hudson (Technical Coordinator), Erin Turney (Creative Assets + Ops), Ana Garcia Doyle (Executive Director) |
| **Term** | Late February 2026 — May 2026 |
| **Rate** | $40 / hour |
| **Budget** | $1,920 (~48 hrs at $40/hr) |
| **Availability** | Flexible; async-primary with weekly sync |

This agreement formalizes the scope of work for Kim supporting OEFF 2026 in host communications operations and coordination during the pre-festival period. Kim provides operational capacity for the communication systems the Technical Coordinator has built, allowing the team to run host-facing processes at scale rather than through a single point of contact.

Festival week on-site support (April 22-27) is described in this agreement as a proposed scope but is scoped and budgeted separately. Both parties will evaluate fit and confirm festival week engagement after the pre-festival collaboration is underway.

## Scope of Work

### Area 1: Host Communications Operations (~26-34 hrs)

#### Webinar & Info Session Support
| Task | Description | Hours |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Webinar reminders + follow-ups | Execute mail merge campaigns for host info sessions using YAMM + Google Sheets | 6-8 hrs |
| RSVP tracking | Monitor responses, update tracking sheet, flag non-responders | 3-4 hrs |
| Recording distribution | Send post-session recordings and materials to registered hosts | 2-3 hrs |
| **Subtotal** | | **11-15 hrs** |

#### Ongoing Host Communications
| Task | Description | Hours |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Scheduled reminders | Execute communications plan streams (deliverables, check-ins, data collection) | 8-10 hrs |
| Host inbox management | Monitor hosts@ shared inbox, triage questions, escalate as needed | 4-5 hrs |
| FAQ documentation | Capture recurring questions and build response templates | 3-4 hrs |
| **Subtotal** | | **15-19 hrs** |

### Area 2: Process Documentation + Digital Tool Maintenance (~10-14 hrs)

This is not a separate deliverable — it's a natural output of doing the work. Digital tool maintenance is collaborative with the Technical Coordinator; Kim won't be solely responsible for any tooling, but will help keep the operational layer running.

| Task | Description | Hours |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Operator notes | Running doc of gaps, friction points, and assumptions in existing processes | 3-4 hrs |
| Template improvements | Refine email templates based on actual use | 2-3 hrs |
| Handoff documentation | What the next person would need to know to do this work | 3 hrs |
| Digital tools + materials upkeep | Ongoing maintenance of shared docs, tracking sheets, and comms tools (in collaboration with Tech Coordinator) | 2-4 hrs |
| **Subtotal** | | **10-14 hrs** |

### Area 3: Filmmaker Communications (~5-8 hrs, as capacity allows)

This is a stretch goal, not a commitment. If host comms are running smoothly by mid-March, Kim may take on filmmaker communication support.

| Task | Description | Hours |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Filmmaker reminders | Logistics emails for deliverables, deadlines, screening details | 3-5 hrs |
| Response tracking | Monitor films@ inbox, track filmmaker responses | 2-3 hrs |
| **Subtotal** | | **5-8 hrs** |

## Festival Week On-Site Support (April 22-27) — Proposed

### Role

Kim serves as on-site Stage / Production Manager for host venue screenings during festival week. She is the primary point of contact for hosts on the ground during screenings.

### Responsibilities

- **Run of show coordination.** Communicate final ROS to hosts in advance. Walk hosts through the flow on arrival. Ensure each screening starts and ends as planned.
- **Host check-ins.** Afternoon arrival at assigned venue(s). Confirm host readiness, resolve last-minute questions, and ensure hosts have what they need before doors open.
- **Program team relay.** Pick up and relay program team decisions to hosts in real time — schedule changes, speaker updates, audience flow adjustments.
- **Intern coordination.** Serve as first line of contact for interns assigned to screenings. Delegate tasks, answer questions, route issues to the appropriate team lead.
- **People wrangling.** Interface with venue tech teams, manage audience flow at the door, and handle the human logistics that keep a screening running smoothly.
- **Escalation.** Route technical issues to Garen (remote) or the on-site AV team. Route programming issues to Ana or Josh.

### Pre-fest-week prep (included)

- Attend Monday host meetings in the weeks leading up to the festival
- Review final ROS documents for assigned venues
- Coordinate with Garen on venue-specific technical requirements
- Confirm intern assignments and brief interns on their roles

### Schedule

All 6 festival days: April 22 (Opening Night) through April 27.

Daily window: afternoon through beginning of screening (~4-6 hours/day depending on venue and event complexity). Heavier days are Thu-Sat when multiple host sites are active simultaneously.

### Compensation

Festival week compensation structure (day rate, total budget) is TBD and will be determined as part of the confirmation process described below.

> Festival week scope is proposed but not yet committed. If both parties agree to proceed, a brief addendum or written acknowledgment will confirm the compensation structure, venue assignments, and schedule.

| **Total** | | **~48 hrs** | **$1,920** |

> Hours are estimates at $40/hr. Garen and Kim will check in at the halfway mark (~$960) to review remaining scope and adjust priorities as needed. Festival week on-site support, if confirmed, will be scoped and compensated separately (see "Festival Week On-Site Support — Proposed" section above).

## Coordination Model

**Kim handles:**
- Day-to-day host communications execution (mail merges, reminders, follow-ups)
- Outreach to gather needed info and host deliverables at various points in time
- Host inbox triage and response
- Process documentation from the operator's perspective
- Filmmaker communications (stretch goal)

**Garen handles:**
- Communication plan design, templates, and automation specs
- Escalation endpoint for complex host questions
- QC on outgoing communications
- Scoping and prioritization of Kim's work

**The handoff:**
- Garen creates the systems (templates, dependency maps, mail merge infrastructure)
- Kim operates within them (runs the merges, sends the emails, monitors responses)
- Kim documents what's missing or broken so the systems improve over time

---

## Tools & Access

Kim will receive access to:
- **hosts@oneearthfilmfest.org** shared inbox (Gmail)
- **Host Communications Plan** (Google Sheets) — templates, schedule, dependency map
- **YAMM** (Yet Another Mail Merge) — Gmail add-on for host email campaigns
- **V7 Google Sheet** — master data source for hosts, events, film matching

## Scope Boundaries

### Included

All work described in Areas 1-3, including coordination with the Technical Coordinator and Creative Assets Lead. Festival week on-site support is proposed but not yet included — see separate section.

### Not included

- Technical infrastructure (building tools, writing code, system configuration)
- Process design or workflow architecture (Kim operates processes, not designs them)
- Budget decisions or vendor management

### Scope change process

If new work arises beyond this scope, Kim will flag it to Garen before beginning. If it can be absorbed within the budget, a brief acknowledgment via text, email, or verbal confirmation is sufficient. If it requires additional budget, both parties will discuss before work begins.
