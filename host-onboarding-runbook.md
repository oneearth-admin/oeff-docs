# OEFF Host Onboarding Runbook

> **What this is:** A step-by-step guide for bringing new community venues on board as OEFF screening hosts.
> **Who it's for:** Ana, support staff, and volunteers who manage host relationships.
> **How to use it:** Each phase is self-contained. Start wherever you are in the process. Every step tells you who does it, what triggers it, what to do, how to verify, and what to do if it fails.

## The Host Journey at a Glance

A venue moves through six phases on its way from "we found them" to "see you next year."

```
1. FIND & QUALIFY     Who are they? Are they a fit?
        |
2. INTAKE & ASSESS    Collect venue details, classify their tech tier
        |
3. MATCH & CONFIRM    Pair a film to the venue, set expectations
        |
4. PREPARE            Countdown to screening day
        |
5. SCREENING DAY      Run the event
        |
6. POST-EVENT         Thank, capture data, re-engage
```

**Pipeline statuses** track where each venue is:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| New Lead | Identified but not yet contacted |
| Contacted | Reached out, awaiting response |
| Interested | Expressed interest, not yet confirmed |
| Confirmed Interest | Agreed in principle, details pending |
| Scheduled | Committed to a screening with date and film |
| Declined | Said no (for now) |
| Inactive | Was active in prior years, not engaged this cycle |

---

## Phase 1: Finding and Qualifying Hosts

**Purpose:** Identify potential venues and determine whether they are a realistic fit for hosting a screening.

### Step 1.1: Identify a Potential Venue

**Who:** Ana or support staff
**Trigger:** Any of these situations:
- A community partner mentions a venue
- A venue contacts OEFF directly (via website, email, or referral)
- You are actively prospecting in an underserved region (check the Events_2026 sheet, Region column, for geographic gaps)
- A prior-year host re-emerges

**Action:**
1. Check the Hosts sheet in V7 to see if this venue already exists.
2. If the venue is already in Hosts, check its current status. If it says "Inactive" or "Declined," skip to Step 1.3 (Re-engaging a Prior Host).
3. If the venue is new, add a row to the Hosts sheet with: Venue Name, Region, Venue Type, and any known contact info.
4. Set Pipeline Status to "New Lead."

**Verify:** The venue appears in the Hosts sheet with status "New Lead."
**If it fails:** If you cannot access V7, write the venue name and contact info in an email to the Tech Coordinator (Garen) and ask them to add it.

---

### Step 1.2: Make First Contact

**Who:** Ana or designated outreach person
**Trigger:** A venue has status "New Lead" in the Hosts sheet.

**Action:**
1. Send a brief introductory email or make a phone call. Include:
   - What OEFF is (distributed environmental film festival, 12th year, April 22-28, 2026)
   - What hosting involves (one screening, typically 60-90 minutes, OEFF provides the film and promotional materials)
   - A question: "Would your venue be open to hosting a screening this April?"
2. Update the venue's Pipeline Status to "Contacted" in the Hosts sheet.
3. Note the date of first contact and the contact method in the Notes column.

**Verify:** Pipeline Status reads "Contacted" and the Notes column has the date and method.
**If it fails:** If you don't hear back within 7 calendar days, send one follow-up email. If no response after the follow-up, leave the status as "Contacted" and move on. Do not send a third message unprompted.

---

### Step 1.3: Re-engage a Prior Host

**Who:** Ana or designated outreach person
**Trigger:** A venue in the Hosts sheet has status "Inactive" and hosted in a prior year.

**Action:**
1. Check the venue's event history (Events sheets from prior years, or Notes column) to understand what they hosted before.
2. Reference their prior participation in your outreach: "You hosted [Film Title] in [Year] and it was a great event. We'd love to work together again."
3. Update Pipeline Status to "Contacted."

**Verify:** Status is "Contacted" and Notes reflect that this is a returning host.
**If it fails:** If the venue declines, update status to "Declined" and note the reason and date. Reasons matter for future outreach — "budget cut" is different from "bad experience."

---

### Step 1.4: Qualify the Venue

**Who:** Ana or support staff
**Trigger:** A venue responds positively to first contact (they say something like "yes," "maybe," or "tell me more").

**Action:** Assess whether this venue can realistically host a screening. A good host has:

- [ ] A space that seats at least 20 people
- [ ] Some form of projection capability (screen, wall, TV — any size)
- [ ] Audio capability (even a basic speaker counts)
- [ ] A contact person willing to coordinate logistics
- [ ] Availability during festival week (April 22-28, 2026)

If the venue meets all five criteria, update Pipeline Status to "Interested."
If the venue meets three or four, update to "Interested" and note which criteria are missing. OEFF may be able to fill gaps (see Phase 4, tech tiers).
If the venue meets fewer than three, update to "Declined" with the reason "Venue not equipped — revisit if circumstances change."

**Verify:** Pipeline Status is "Interested" and the Notes column documents what the venue has and what it lacks.
**If it fails:** If you cannot assess the venue remotely, schedule a brief call or site visit. Do not guess at capabilities — wrong assumptions cause problems on screening day.

---

## Phase 2: Intake and Assessment

**Purpose:** Collect structured information about the venue's space, equipment, and accessibility so OEFF can plan the right level of support.

### Step 2.1: Send the Host Intake Form

**Who:** Ana or support staff
**Trigger:** A venue's Pipeline Status is "Interested" or "Confirmed Interest."

**Action:**
1. Send the host intake form to the venue contact. The intake form collects:
   - Venue name and address
   - Primary contact name, email, and phone
   - Room dimensions and seating capacity
   - AV equipment available (projector, screen, speakers, microphone, HDMI input)
   - Internet availability (needed for Google Slides presentations)
   - Accessibility features (wheelchair access, hearing loop, parking)
   - Preferred screening dates and times within the festival window
   - Any restrictions (noise ordinances, curfews, setup/teardown time limits)
2. Note in the Hosts sheet that the intake form was sent, with the date.

**Verify:** The venue contact confirmed receipt of the intake form (email reply, verbal confirmation, or form submission notification).
**If it fails:** If no response within 5 business days, send one follow-up with the subject line "OEFF Intake Form — Quick Follow-Up." If still no response after 5 more days, call the contact directly. If unreachable after three attempts across two weeks, update Notes with "Intake form unresponsive" and leave status as-is. Revisit in one week.

---

### Step 2.2: Process a Completed Intake Form

**Who:** Support staff or Ana
**Trigger:** A host intake form response arrives.

**Action:**
1. Open the Host_Intake sheet in V7.
2. Confirm the response is recorded there. If the intake form is connected to Google Sheets, responses appear automatically. If responses arrive via email, manually enter the data.
3. Check for completeness:
   - If any critical field is blank (venue name, contact info, capacity, or AV equipment), email the contact to request the missing information. Do not proceed to tier classification until these fields are filled.
   - If only non-critical fields are blank (e.g., parking details), proceed and note what is missing.

**Verify:** The Host_Intake sheet has a complete row for this venue with no blank critical fields.
**If it fails:** If the data looks wrong (e.g., capacity listed as "0" or AV equipment listed as "no" for a professional cinema), contact the venue to confirm. Data entry errors are common and cheaper to fix now than on screening day.

---

### Step 2.3: Classify the Venue's Technical Tier

**Who:** Tech Coordinator (Garen) or Ana with Tech Coordinator guidance
**Trigger:** A completed intake form exists in Host_Intake for this venue.

**Action:** Assign the venue a Technical Tier in the Hosts sheet based on its equipment and experience:

| Tier | Description | What OEFF Provides | Example Venues |
|------|-------------|--------------------|----|
| Tier 1: Full-Service | No AV equipment or experience. OEFF brings everything. | Projector, screen, speakers, laptop, full tech support on-site | Community rooms, churches without AV |
| Tier 2: Partial Support | Has some equipment (e.g., a TV or projector) but needs help with setup or has gaps. | Fill equipment gaps, provide setup guidance, remote or on-call tech support | Libraries with a projector but no dedicated AV, cultural centers |
| Tier 3: Self-Sufficient | Has full AV setup and experienced staff. Needs only the film file and presentation materials. | Film file, Google Slides deck, trailers, promotional materials | Professional cinemas (Music Box, Gene Siskel), universities with AV staff |

1. Review the intake form's AV equipment section.
2. Assign the tier in the Hosts sheet (Technical_Tier column).
3. If the tier assignment is uncertain (e.g., the venue says "we have a projector" but you don't know its condition), flag it for a follow-up call or site visit.

**Verify:** The Hosts sheet shows a Technical Tier value for this venue.
**If it fails:** If you cannot determine the tier from the intake form alone, schedule a 10-minute call with the venue contact to walk through their setup. Ask them to send a photo of their AV equipment and the room. A photo resolves 90% of ambiguity.

---

## Phase 3: Matching and Confirmation

**Purpose:** Pair a film to the venue, get the host's commitment, and set clear expectations about who provides what.

### Step 3.1: Match a Film to the Venue

**Who:** Ana (Executive Director)
**Trigger:** A venue has a completed intake form AND a Technical Tier assigned.

**Action:**
1. Open the Ana_Matching sheet in V7.
2. Review the venue's profile: capacity, location, audience type, and any preferences the host expressed.
3. Consider:
   - Does the film's subject matter fit the community the venue serves?
   - Does the film's runtime fit the venue's time constraints?
   - Does the venue's capacity match the expected audience size for this film?
   - Are there geographic balance concerns? (Check the Region column — avoid clustering all screenings in one area.)
4. Record the match in Ana_Matching: Venue Name, Film Title, and any notes about why this pairing works.

**Verify:** The Ana_Matching sheet has a row linking this venue to a specific film.
**If it fails:** If no film is an obvious match, flag the venue in the Ana_Matching sheet with a note: "Needs match — [reason]." Return to it after reviewing remaining unmatched films. If no match is found by 4 weeks before the festival, contact the host to discuss whether a different format (e.g., a panel discussion with a short film) would work, or whether to defer to next year.

> **Note:** 9 unmatched intake forms were pending Ana's review as of early February 2026. Check the Ana_Matching sheet for the current count.

---

### Step 3.2: Confirm the Screening with the Host

**Who:** Ana or designated outreach person
**Trigger:** A film has been matched to the venue in Ana_Matching.

**Action:**
1. Contact the host (email or phone) with:
   - The film title and a brief description
   - The proposed screening date and time
   - A summary of what OEFF provides (see Step 3.3)
   - A summary of what the host provides (see Step 3.3)
   - A request for the host to confirm or propose an alternative date
2. If the host confirms:
   - Update Pipeline Status to "Scheduled" in the Hosts sheet.
   - Add the event to Events_2026 with: Venue_ID, Film_ID, Event_Date, and Pipeline_Status = "Scheduled."
   - Assign a Team_Contact in Events_2026 (the OEFF person responsible for this screening).
3. If the host wants a different date or film:
   - Work with Ana to find an alternative.
   - Update Ana_Matching with the new information.
   - Repeat this step with the revised proposal.
4. If the host declines:
   - Update Pipeline Status to "Declined" and note the reason.
   - Return the film to the unmatched pool.

**Verify:** Events_2026 has a row for this screening with a date, venue, film, and Team_Contact. Pipeline Status is "Scheduled."
**If it fails:** If the host is unresponsive after confirmation outreach, follow the same escalation as Step 2.1: one follow-up email at 5 days, a phone call at 10 days, and a flag-for-review at 14 days.

---

### Step 3.3: Set Expectations

**Who:** Ana or designated outreach person
**Trigger:** The host has confirmed (Pipeline Status = "Scheduled").

**Action:** Send the host a clear summary of responsibilities. Use this template:

**What OEFF provides:**
- The film file (digital format, delivered before the screening)
- Google Slides presentation deck (opening and closing slides)
- Opening and closing trailers
- Promotional materials (poster, social media graphics, event listing on OEFF website)
- Technical support (level depends on venue tier — see below)
- A presenter or moderator (if available and requested)

**What the host provides:**
- The venue space on the agreed date and time
- AV setup (Tier 3 venues) or AV access and a contact person for setup (Tier 1-2 venues)
- A greeter or point person to welcome the audience
- Chairs/seating arranged for the screening
- Promotion to their own community (social media, newsletters, bulletin boards)

**Technical support by tier:**

| Tier | OEFF Tech Support |
|------|-------------------|
| Tier 1 | OEFF provides all equipment and an on-site tech person |
| Tier 2 | OEFF fills equipment gaps and provides remote/on-call tech support |
| Tier 3 | OEFF provides the files; venue handles all AV independently |

**Verify:** The host replied confirming they understand their responsibilities, or asked clarifying questions that you answered.
**If it fails:** If the host seems confused or overwhelmed, offer a 15-minute phone call to walk through the plan. Confusion at this stage is cheaper to resolve than confusion on screening day.

---

## Phase 4: Pre-Event Preparation

**Purpose:** Ensure everything is ready before the screening. This phase runs on a countdown from the screening date.

### Step 4.1: Follow the Preparation Timeline

**Who:** Team Contact assigned to this screening (see Events_2026, Team_Contact column)
**Trigger:** Pipeline Status is "Scheduled" and the screening is within 4 weeks.

**Action:** Follow this countdown:

| When | What | Who |
|------|------|-----|
| 4 weeks before | Confirm the screening date with the host (a brief "still on?" email or text) | Team Contact |
| 3 weeks before | Deliver the film file to the host (file transfer link, USB drive, or streaming access) | Tech Coordinator |
| 3 weeks before | Send promotional materials to the host (poster PDF, social media graphics, event description) | Ana or support staff |
| 2 weeks before | Ask the host to test the film file on their equipment. Request a photo or text confirmation that it plays. | Team Contact |
| 2 weeks before | Confirm presenter/moderator (if applicable) and share the presenter guide (tonight-runsheet.html) | Team Contact |
| 1 week before | Send the Google Slides deck and trailer files to the presenter or host | Tech Coordinator |
| 1 week before | Confirm day-of logistics: arrival time, setup time, venue access, parking, key contact phone number | Team Contact |
| Day before | Send a final confirmation text or email to the host: "See you tomorrow at [time]. Call [phone] if anything comes up." | Team Contact |

**Verify:** Each item on the timeline has been completed and noted. The simplest method: keep a checklist per event in the Notes column of Events_2026, or in a separate document per screening.
**If it fails:** If you miss a deadline, do the task immediately and compress the remaining timeline. The critical path items are: film file delivered (must happen), slides/trailers delivered (must happen), and day-of logistics confirmed (must happen). Promotional materials are important but not blocking.

---

### Step 4.2: Handle Tech Setup by Venue Tier

**Who:** Tech Coordinator (Garen) for Tier 1-2; host's own staff for Tier 3
**Trigger:** Screening is within 2 weeks.

**Action by tier:**

**Tier 1 (Full-Service):**
1. Identify the equipment needed: projector, screen, speakers, cables, laptop.
2. Confirm equipment availability (OEFF inventory or rental).
3. Schedule an on-site setup person for the day of the screening. Arrive at least 90 minutes before showtime.
4. If renting equipment, confirm the rental order and delivery/pickup logistics.
5. Plan a test run at the venue if possible (ideally during the "2 weeks before" window).

**Tier 2 (Partial Support):**
1. Confirm which equipment gaps OEFF is filling (from the intake form and tier classification).
2. Deliver or ship the supplemental equipment.
3. Provide setup instructions specific to this venue's configuration. Include: what cables to use, where to plug in, how to switch inputs.
4. Confirm a remote tech support contact (phone number) for the day of the screening.

**Tier 3 (Self-Sufficient):**
1. Confirm the host received the film file and it plays on their system.
2. Send the Google Slides deck and trailer files.
3. Share the presenter guide: tonight-runsheet.html (this has step-by-step instructions for running slides and trailers using Google Slides and VLC).
4. Confirm the host has a plan for running the show. No further OEFF tech involvement is needed unless the host requests it.

**Verify:** For Tier 1-2: equipment is confirmed and a tech contact is assigned. For Tier 3: the host confirmed the film plays and they have the presenter guide.
**If it fails:** If equipment is unavailable, check rental options immediately. If rental is not possible within budget, contact Ana to discuss: downgrade the screening format, borrow from another venue, or reschedule. Do not cancel without Ana's approval.

---

### Step 4.3: Brief the Presenter

**Who:** Team Contact
**Trigger:** A presenter or moderator has been assigned to this screening AND the screening is within 2 weeks.

**Action:**
1. Share the presenter guide: `tonight-runsheet.html`. This guide covers:
   - Setting up VLC for trailers
   - Setting up Google Slides for the presentation deck
   - The show flow (opening trailer, slides, closing trailer)
   - Keyboard shortcuts for VLC and Slides
   - Troubleshooting common problems
2. Confirm the presenter has access to: the slide deck (Google Slides link), the trailer files, and VLC installed on the presenting computer.
3. Confirm the presenter knows: the venue address, arrival time (at least 30 minutes before showtime for Tier 3, 60 minutes for Tier 2, 90 minutes for Tier 1), and the host's phone number.

**Verify:** The presenter replied confirming they have the guide, the files, and the logistics.
**If it fails:** If the presenter drops out less than 1 week before the screening, escalate to Ana immediately. Options: find a replacement presenter, ask the host if someone on their staff can run the show using the presenter guide, or have the Tech Coordinator provide remote support via phone during the screening.

---

## Phase 5: Screening Day

**Purpose:** Make sure the event runs smoothly. Catch problems early and know who to call.

### Step 5.1: Day-of Contact Protocol

**Who:** Team Contact for this screening
**Trigger:** The day of the screening.

**Action:**
1. **Morning (by 10 AM):** Send a brief text to the host contact: "Looking forward to tonight. We'll be there at [arrival time]. Text me if anything changes."
2. **Arrival:** Arrive at the venue at the agreed time (see Step 4.3 for arrival windows by tier).
3. **Setup check:** Walk through the technical setup. For Tier 1-2, set up and test all equipment. For Tier 3, confirm with the host that their setup is ready.
4. **Sound check:** Play 10 seconds of the trailer to verify audio levels and video quality in the actual room, with the actual equipment, at the actual distance from the screen.
5. **15 minutes before showtime:** Confirm the presenter is ready, the slides are loaded, and VLC is cued to the opening trailer.

**Verify:** Equipment works, audio is audible from the back of the room, video is visible and in focus, and the presenter knows the show flow.
**If it fails:** See Step 5.2 (Escalation Paths).

---

### Step 5.2: Escalation Paths

**Who:** Whoever is on-site or the Team Contact
**Trigger:** Something goes wrong on screening day.

Use this decision tree:

**Problem: Tech issue (no picture, no sound, wrong file format)**
1. Try the troubleshooting steps in tonight-runsheet.html (the "If Something Goes Wrong" section).
2. If not resolved in 5 minutes, call the Tech Coordinator (Garen).
3. If the Tech Coordinator is unavailable, try these fallbacks in order:
   - Switch to a backup laptop (if available)
   - Play the film directly from a laptop screen for a small audience
   - Stream the film if the venue has reliable internet
4. If none of these work, apologize to the audience, explain the situation, and offer to reschedule. Collect contact info from attendees who want to be notified of the new date.

**Problem: Low attendance (fewer than 5 people)**
1. Run the screening anyway. Even a small audience is a real event.
2. Note the attendance count for the post-event report.
3. After the event, discuss with Ana whether the venue, timing, or promotion approach should change for next year.

**Problem: Venue issue (locked doors, no power, double-booked)**
1. Call the host contact immediately.
2. If the host contact is unreachable, call Ana.
3. If the venue cannot be accessed: check whether a nearby OEFF host venue is available as a backup (check Events_2026 for other screenings in the same region that day).
4. If no backup is possible, notify attendees at the door and collect contact info for rescheduling.

**Problem: Safety concern (weather, building issue, disruptive person)**
1. Safety comes first. Cancel or pause the screening if needed. No film is worth a safety risk.
2. Call 911 for emergencies.
3. Notify Ana as soon as practical.

**Verify:** The problem is resolved and the screening proceeds, or a clear decision has been made to reschedule.
**If it fails:** Document what happened (in the Notes column of Events_2026 or via email to Ana). Every failure teaches us something for next year.

---

### Step 5.3: What "Done" Looks Like

**Who:** Whoever is on-site
**Trigger:** The screening has ended.

**Checklist — before you leave the venue:**
- [ ] Equipment is packed up and accounted for (Tier 1-2 venues)
- [ ] The venue is returned to its original state (chairs repositioned, lights on, doors secured as instructed by host)
- [ ] You thanked the host contact in person
- [ ] You have a rough attendance count (count chairs occupied, or ask the host)
- [ ] You noted any issues that came up (equipment problems, audience feedback, venue concerns)

**Verify:** You can answer these questions: How many people attended? Did anything go wrong? Would this venue host again?
**If it fails:** If you forgot to get the attendance count, email the host the next morning and ask for their estimate.

---

## Phase 6: Post-Event

**Purpose:** Close the loop. Thank the host, capture what happened, and plant the seed for next year.

### Step 6.1: Send a Thank-You

**Who:** Ana or Team Contact
**Trigger:** Within 48 hours after the screening.

**Action:**
1. Send a thank-you email to the host contact. Include:
   - A genuine, specific thank-you ("Thank you for hosting [Film Title] at [Venue Name]. The turnout was great and the space was perfect.")
   - The attendance count (if known)
   - A mention of anything that went particularly well
   - A note that you will follow up with a brief feedback request
2. If OEFF has post-event social media content (photos, quotes), share it with the host so they can post it too.

**Verify:** The email was sent and the host acknowledged it (a reply, a "thanks," or even just no bounce-back).
**If it fails:** If you miss the 48-hour window, send it anyway. A late thank-you is better than no thank-you.

---

### Step 6.2: Capture Event Data

**Who:** Team Contact or support staff
**Trigger:** Within 1 week after the screening.

**Action:**
1. Update the Events_2026 sheet with:
   - Actual attendance count
   - Any notes about the event (what went well, what didn't, audience reactions, venue issues)
   - Whether the host expressed interest in participating next year (yes, maybe, no, or unknown)
2. If equipment was rented, confirm it has been returned and the rental is closed out.
3. If there were technical issues, email the Tech Coordinator with a brief summary so the issue can be addressed for future screenings.

**Verify:** The Events_2026 row for this screening has attendance, notes, and a "return interest" indicator filled in.
**If it fails:** If you do not have attendance data, put your best estimate and mark it as "estimated" in the notes. An estimate is better than a blank.

---

### Step 6.3: Collect Host Feedback

**Who:** Ana or support staff
**Trigger:** 1-2 weeks after the screening (give the host time to decompress).

**Action:**
1. Send a brief feedback request to the host. Keep it to 3-5 questions:
   - How was your experience hosting an OEFF screening?
   - Was there anything we could have done better to support you?
   - Would you be interested in hosting again next year?
   - Any other thoughts or suggestions?
2. Record responses in the Hosts sheet Notes column, or in a dedicated feedback document.

**Verify:** Feedback was requested. If the host responds, their feedback is recorded.
**If it fails:** If the host does not respond to the feedback request, do not send a second request. Note "Feedback requested, no response" in the Hosts sheet. Their silence is not a problem — they may just be busy.

---

### Step 6.4: Re-engagement for Next Year

**Who:** Ana
**Trigger:** Post-festival wrap-up period (May 2026), after all screenings are complete.

**Action:**
1. Review the Hosts sheet. For each venue that hosted this year:
   - If the host said "yes" to hosting again: Update status to "Interested" for next year's cycle. Add a note: "Returning host — hosted [Film] in 2026."
   - If the host said "maybe": Update status to "Contacted" for next year. Add a note with their hesitation.
   - If the host said "no" or was unresponsive: Update status to "Inactive." Note the reason.
2. For new leads that were never reached or declined this year, review whether circumstances have changed and re-enter them as "New Lead" for next year's cycle.
3. Archive the current year's event data (lock the Events_2026 sheet to prevent accidental edits: right-click the sheet tab, select "Protect sheet," set permissions to "View only").

**Verify:** Every venue that participated this year has a status set for next year's cycle. Events_2026 is protected.
**If it fails:** If the post-festival review does not happen in May, schedule it for June. This data decays — by September, you will have forgotten the nuances. The review does not need to be perfect. It needs to exist.
