# IRS Contractor Classification: What Ana Needs to Know

*Internal note — not part of the contract itself. For Garen's conversation with Ana.*

---

## Why this matters

The IRS distinguishes between employees and independent contractors. If a nonprofit misclassifies someone, the org can owe back taxes, penalties, and benefits. This applies to Garen's agreement and to anyone else OEFF brings in (Kim, other collaborators, etc.).

OEFF is already operating a contractor model — this note is about making sure the practices match the paperwork.

## What strengthens contractor classification (we're doing these right)

- Garen controls own schedule, methods, and tools
- Garen is not economically dependent on OEFF (has full-time employment elsewhere)
- Garen can delegate work to subcontractors (the delegation clause)
- Garen works for other clients simultaneously
- Garen provides own equipment (laptop, software, etc.)
- The agreement includes independent contractor acknowledgment language
- Either party can terminate with notice

## What could undermine contractor classification (flag to Ana)

### The Wednesday squad meeting

**The issue:** Regular, recurring attendance at staff meetings is one of the IRS factors that suggests an employment relationship. The 11:45am Wednesday squad meeting is a standing team meeting.

**The fix:** The contract already says Garen attends "when schedule permits" and "cannot guarantee weekly attendance." This language is good. But in practice:
- Don't make attendance mandatory or penalize absence
- Don't refer to Garen as part of "staff" in meeting invites or team communications
- Frame Garen's participation as "coordination check-in" rather than "staff meeting"
- If Garen can't attend, that should be unremarkable — not something requiring excuse or notification

### Org email addresses

**The issue:** Providing an organizational email address (e.g., garen@oneearthfilmfest.org) can suggest an employment relationship.

**The fix:** If Garen is using or managing OEFF email accounts (shared mailboxes, hosts@ address), frame this as a system being administered, not a personal org email. Garen's own communications should come from a personal or business email, not an @oneearthfilmfest.org address.

### Setting specific work hours

**The issue:** Requiring a contractor to work specific hours (e.g., "be available 9-5 on Fridays") suggests employment.

**The fix:** The contract specifies availability windows (evenings, weekends) — this is Garen stating when they choose to work, not OEFF dictating hours. Maintain this framing. Don't create schedules or require specific hours.

## How to talk about this with Ana

This doesn't need to be a heavy conversation. Something like:

> "One thing I want to flag as we formalize contracts — the IRS has specific rules about contractor vs. employee classification. We're in good shape because I control my own schedule, have other clients, and use my own equipment. The one thing to watch is making sure our team meetings and communications don't accidentally create an employee-like dynamic — so things like, I attend squad meetings when I can but it's not required, and I communicate from my own email. Worth being aware of as we bring more contractors in too."

This positions you as protecting the org, not making demands. It also creates a framework for how Kim and other future collaborators should be structured.

## Applies to all OEFF contractors

This isn't just about Garen's contract. Every contractor OEFF brings in should have:

1. A written agreement (even a simple one)
2. Independent contractor acknowledgment language
3. No mandatory meeting attendance
4. No org-issued email address
5. Control over their own schedule and methods
6. 1099 at year-end (not W-2)

This is especially relevant given that interns were brought in without formal agreements. If interns are unpaid and receiving academic credit, that's a different classification — but it still needs documentation.
